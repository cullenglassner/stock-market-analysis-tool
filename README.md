F# stock market analysis tool with some simple computation for moving averages.

To run the charting software, execute the ChartingTools.fsx script with the F# Interpreter.
It will automatically load the AnalysisTools library.

To change which stocks are seen open AnalysisTools and change <symbolList> at the top of the file.

Comments throughout code show some functional specialties of F# as well as how to run some imperative code in F#.
